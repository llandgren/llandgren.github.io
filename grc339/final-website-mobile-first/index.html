                        <p><span id="quote">Let's define <em>useful</em> as the opposite of <em>wasteful</em>.</span> At Useful Habits, we believe that everyone has the potential to create new habits in order to reduce their wastefulness. Our goal is to share knowledge with you, our community, that will empower you as you journey towards a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>
                       <p> We also understand that change is difficult, and we want to emphasize that it is perfectly acceptable to take these changes one step at a time. When all of us make incremental changes to our everyday routines, together we can make a significant change. We are here to facilitate conversations about waste reduction and lifestyle adjustments for sustainability, and throughout this site you can find information about upcycling, practicing consumer mindfulness, and many more subjects. Please take a look around and learn about how you can make small changes to your daily routine that help protect our planet.</p>

                        <p>If you're anything like me, you don't enjoy the idea of spending hundreds of dollars on a new set of dining chairs. Purchasing new furniture is a big investment and, when it arrives, your old furniture will be send to the landfill, so I propose that this DIY alternative is the most satisfying solution. ...</p>

                                <p>It's so sad to throw away food that was perfectly good just a few days ago. Fruits in particular age all too quickly, but good news: there are lots of ways to use fruits even after they become too ripe to be enjoyed raw. Check out these recipes for some good ideas on how to reduce your fruit waste. ...</p>

                        <p>Over the past few years, a variety of plant-based milk alternatives have entered the mainstream market, and this is exciting. People with allergies and intolerances are now given options. But plant-milks require much less energy and resources to produce than cow's milk, so why are they priced so high? I can buy a massive tub of dry oats for $2, but just one carton of oatmilk, which is made up mostly of water and a small scoop of oats, costs $6, so what is going on?...</p>
