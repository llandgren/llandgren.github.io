                        <p><span id="quote">Let's define <em>useful</em> as the opposite of <em>wasteful</em>.</span> At Useful Habits, we believe that everyone has the potential to create new habits in order to reduce their wastefulness. Our goal is to share knowledge with you, our community, that will empower you as you journey towards a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>
                       <p> We also understand that change is difficult, and we want to emphasize that it is perfectly acceptable to take these changes one step at a time. When all of us make incremental changes to our everyday routines, together we can make a significant change. We are here to facilitate conversations about waste reduction and lifestyle adjustments for sustainability, and throughout this site you can find information about upcycling, practicing consumer mindfulness, and many more subjects. Please take a look around and learn about how you can make small changes to your daily routine that help protect our planet.</p>
