                    <p class="teaser"><span class="beginning">Hey there beautiful you!</span> I'm so happy you're here! I have truly been enjoying a season of less stress and more downtime! While everyone else is frantically decorating for fall, I haven't even ventured into my attic. I've been working on small projects around my home, like this one... reupholstering my dining room chairs in classic houndstooth! If you learn this easy technique, you can save yourself so much money! You can get a new look anytime you like! Reupholstering dining chairs is really easy and I can't wait to show you how!</p>

                    <p>Here's what you'll need:</p>


                        <ul class="inline-list"><li>screwdriver or drill</li>
                        <li>roughly 1/2 yard of fabric per seat</li> 
                        <li>sharp scissors</li>
                        <li>heavy duty staple gun</li>
                        <li>3/8" heavy duty staples</li>
                        <li>ScotchGard fabric protector</li>
                        </ul>    

                        <p>That's it! It's a small list and a very do-able project! Before we get to the "how-to", let me tell you a little story about how we came to own this table and chairs set.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="fabrics.jpg" alt="Various fabrics with diverse colors and patterns displayed in a store.">
                            <figcaption>You can use scraps of fabric from your house or you can go to the fabric store to pick out the perfect fabric.</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                       
                        <h3>Step One</h3>
                         <p>Flip your chairs over. You'll see a screw hole in each corner. Remove seats from chairs with a screwdriver. Set screws aside somewhere safe because you'll be reusing them!</p>
                    
                        <h3>Step Two</h3>
                        <p>Lay your fabric out, wrong side up, on a large flat surface. Set one seat upside down along a corner. You'll want to cut your fabric with an overlap of 1-2" (that means that 1-2" will wrap over to the back of the seat). Start with the larger number! If you have a pattern on your fabric, make sure to line it up properly so it's straight. Cut the fabric essentially in a large square around the seat.</p>

                        <h3>Step Three</h3>
                        <p>The way I like to attach the fabric is to staple the middle of each side opposite each other. So I pulled the fabric around and stapled the top, then the bottom, then the right and left. Here I have a staple in the top and the bottom.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Step Four</h3>
                        <p>Once I have my four staples in place on each side, I add a couple more to each side of that.</p>

                        <h3>Step Five</h3>
                        <p>Here's how to get perfect corners. Staple the sides up to about 2-3" from the corner. Smooth fabric and pull the corner fabric to the middle of the seat, then overlap each side, one at a time, with a fold.</p>

                            <figcaption>Most chairs with cushions are screwed on, so remove them using a screwdriver. <a class="source" href="https://www.diybeautify.com/2019/09/how-to-easily-reupholster-dining-seat-cushions.html">source</a></figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <h3>Step Six</h3>
                        <p>Continue stapling any areas that need it so you have staples 1-2" apart all the way around the chair.</p>

                        <h3>Step Seven</h3>
                        <p>Trim the excess fabric to reduce the bulk. To make reattaching the seats easier, make sure you can see your screw holes. If they're covered in fabric, that's ok, but it will be more difficult to reattach.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="staple-gun.jpg" alt="Staple gun placed on cushion to show that this tool was used to attach new fabric to the cusion.">
                            <figcaption>The fastest way to fasten the new fabric is to use a staple gun. This method works well since the bottom of the chair is rarely seen. <a class="source" href="https://www.diybeautify.com/2019/09/how-to-easily-reupholster-dining-seat-cushions.html">source</a></figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <h3>Step Eight</h3>
                        <p>This step is super important unless you want to be reupholstering your chairs again in a month! Take a couple hours and spray a couple light coats of ScotchGard on each seat cushion. This will help to block stains and make clean up easier! I took my seat cushions outside to my patio and protected the surface with a large piece of plywood. I was only able to do two at a time, so it took awhile, but I'm glad I took this extra step to protect the fabric!</p>
                    
                        <p>Thank you for reading this tutorial, I hope that you found this project as inspiring as it was for me. Please let me know how it goes when you reupholster your own dining seat cushions!</p>
